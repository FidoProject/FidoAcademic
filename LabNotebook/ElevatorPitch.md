#Elevator Pitch

- We created a robot control system, nicknamed Fido, that could be trained rather than programmed in a minimal amount of time.
	- Trainability: Allow human training and retraining
	- Universality: No dynamic model
	- Speed: 3x faster than industry standard, low latency
	
	To achieve this we developed a novel machine learning algorithm utilizing wire-fitted Q-Learning with a neural network, a probabilistic action selection model, and history sampling.
