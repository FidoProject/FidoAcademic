\begin{abstract}

A robot control system was developed that could be taught tasks through reinforcement learning.  The system, nicknamed Fido, was designed to be universal regardless of the specific hardware inputs and outputs and does not need to be modified for the task at hand. In addition, Fido was built to learn with limited feedback, allowing humans to train Fido in a reasonable time frame. This was achieved through the training of artificial neural networks with a wire-fitted moving least squares interpolator following the $Q$-learning reinforcement algorithm and an action selection policy that utilizes a Boltzmann distribution of probability. A kinematically accurate robot was simulated with a differential drive system, a sensor array, and other outputs.  The robot was successfully trained to do an array of tasks with limited feedback, such as line following, driving to a set location, and blinking a multicolor light-emitting diode.
