# Title of Paper
## Outline

### Abstract
- Purpose was to implement machine learning in the context of a robotic creature
- Using a novel implementation we were succesful in teaching a simulation numerous tasks

### Introduction

- Application of machine learning more concrete "intelligence" tasks
- Idea to apply machine learning to a robotic model, artificial creature
- Real creatures have inputs and outputs, and learn through reinforcement: psychology, etc

### Neural Network Background

### Q-Learning
- Discrete Q-learning
- Wire fitted q-learning

### Novel Reinforcement Learning Implementation

### Simulator
- Speak about reason for building the simulator
  - It allows us to prototype without having to build a hardware implementation
- Simulator Functionality
  - Sensor choices
  - Differential drive kinematic model
  - Electromagnetic emitter model

### Results
- Tasks that Fido has learned
  - Turning on an LED when given the proper stimulus
  - Driving straight
  - Driving towards a electromagnetic emitter
  - Driving quickly
- Results when taught by a machine
  - Number of reward iterations needed
  - Time needed each reward iteration
- Results when taught by humans
  - Number of reward iteration needed
  - Time needed each reward iteration
- Lots and lots of bar graphs 

### Discussion
- Comparison to other implementations
- Results vs hypothesized
- Relation back to introduction concepts
- Future work: hardware implementation, etc

### Conclusion
- Restate stuff about what we did, how we did it
- Restate discussion results (not raw data, just interpretation of said data)
	- Ex: this looks promising
