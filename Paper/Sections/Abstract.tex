\begin{abstract}

A universal robot control system was created that could be trained rather than programmed in a matter of minutes.
The system, nicknamed “Fido”, was designed to be trained by non-experts, to run on any robot regardless of inputs and outputs, robot kinematics, and processing capability, and to learn with limited human administered feedback.
To achieve this, Fido utilizes the Q-learning reinforcement learning algorithm coupled with an artificial neural network and a wire-fitted interpolator, follows an intelligent action selection policy, efficiently adjusts its model architecture, and trains itself on samples of past experiences.
Functionality was tested on a robotic simulator and three robots of differing kinematics, sensors, and central processors.
Fido successfully converged on all given tasks in simulation and in hardware with an average of \textbf{four times less feedback} than the industry standard trainable control system, while maintaining impressively low latency even on a \$5 computer.
