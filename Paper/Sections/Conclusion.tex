Fido successfully met our objectives of trainablility, universality, and performance.
Fido was trainable and re-trainable on a wide range of unique tasks by non-expert humans.
The system was fully universal, achieving similar performance on a simulator and three distinct robots.
Fido also converged on all of its tasks with an average of four times fewer learning iterations than the industry standard trainable control system, discrete Q-learning with neural networks.
The control system was also able to effectively cope with noisy sensor values and human-given reward, while maintaining such little latency as to allow it to be run on a \$5 dollar computer.
The increase in performance and universality presented by Fido makes it a viable alternative over traditional procedurally programmed systems.
